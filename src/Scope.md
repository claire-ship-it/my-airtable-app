Project Description:
This project is a React-based web application that provides analytics for ABC Cleaning bookings. It fetches data from Airtable and displays it in various formats, including tables, charts, and animated lists. The application also features an AI Assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to answer questions about the business data.

Recent Changes:
1. Implemented a new layout with magic UI cards for key metrics.
2. Added circular progress bars for Recurring Customers and Total Bookings.
3. Integrated an AI Assistant component with Ant Design's TextArea.
4. Created animated lists for Recent Bookings and Recent Reviews.
5. Improved overall styling and responsiveness of the application.
6. Implemented error handling and data validation for Airtable API responses.

Key Components:
1. AIAssistant: An interactive component that allows users to ask questions about the business data.
2. BookingsPieChart: Visualizes booking data by service type.
3. BookingsBarChart: Displays booking frequency data.
4. AnimatedList: A reusable component for displaying recent bookings and reviews with animation.
5. Circular progress bars for Recurring Customers and Total Bookings.

Connections:
- The app uses Airtable API to fetch booking records.
- OpenAI API is used for the AI Assistant functionality.
- React and various libraries (Chart.js, react-chartjs-2, Ant Design) are used for the frontend.

Potential Failure Points:
1. Airtable API connection: If the Personal Access Token is invalid or the connection fails, data won't be fetched.
2. OpenAI API: If the API key is missing or invalid, the AI Assistant won't function.
3. Environment variables: Missing or incorrect environment variables can cause the app to fail.
4. Data format changes: If the Airtable data structure changes, it may break the data processing and display components.

Next Steps:
1. Implement the AI Assistant functionality using the OpenAI API.
2. Add more interactive features to the charts and lists.
3. Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
4. Create a backend API to handle data processing and caching.
5. Implement real-time data updates using webhooks or polling.
