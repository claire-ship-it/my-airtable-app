Project Description:
This project is a React-based web application that provides analytics for ABC Cleaning bookings. It fetches data from Airtable and displays it in various formats, including charts, progress bars, and animated lists. The application features an AI Assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to answer questions about the business data.

Key Components:
1. AIAssistant: An interactive component that allows users to ask questions about the business data.
2. BookingsPieChart: Visualizes booking data by service type.
3. BookingsBarChart: Displays booking frequency data.
4. AnimatedList: A reusable component for displaying recent bookings and reviews with animation.
5. TimeframeSelector: Allows users to filter data by month, quarter, or year.
6. PulsatingButton: A custom UI component for the AI Assistant's submit button.

Recent Changes:
1. Implemented a new layout with magic UI cards for key metrics.
2. Added circular progress bars for Recurring Customers and Total Bookings.
3. Integrated an AI Assistant component with a custom PulsatingButton.
4. Created animated lists for Recent Bookings and Recent Reviews.
5. Implemented a TimeframeSelector for data filtering.
6. Adjusted chart sizes and layout for better visualization.
7. Improved overall styling and responsiveness of the application.

Connections:
- The app uses Airtable API to fetch booking records.
- OpenAI API is used for the AI Assistant functionality.
- React and various libraries (Chart.js, react-chartjs-2, Ant Design) are used for the frontend.

Potential Failure Points:
1. Airtable API connection: If the Personal Access Token is invalid or the connection fails, data won't be fetched.
2. OpenAI API: If the API key is missing or invalid, the AI Assistant won't function.
3. Environment variables: Missing or incorrect environment variables can cause the app to fail.
4. Data format changes: If the Airtable data structure changes, it may break the data processing and display components.

Next Steps:
1. Implement the AI Assistant functionality using the OpenAI API.
2. Add more interactive features to the charts and lists.
3. Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
4. Create a backend API to handle data processing and caching.
5. Implement real-time data updates using webhooks or polling.
6. Enhance the TimeframeSelector to allow for custom date ranges.
7. Optimize performance for larger datasets.
