Project Description:
This project is a React-based web application that provides analytics for ABC Cleaning bookings. It fetches data from Airtable and displays it in various formats, including tables and charts. The application also features an AI Assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to answer questions about the business data.
Key Components:
1. AIAssistant: An interactive component that allows users to ask questions about the business data.
BookingsTable: Displays booking data in a tabular format.
3. BookingsPieChart and BookingsBarChart: Visualize booking data using charts.
Connections:
The app uses Airtable API to fetch booking records.
OpenAI API is used for the AI Assistant functionality.
React and various libraries (Chart.js, react-chartjs-2) are used for the frontend.
Potential Failure Points:
1. Airtable API connection: If the API key is invalid or the connection fails, data won't be fetched.
OpenAI API: If the API key is missing or invalid, the AI Assistant won't function.
Environment variables: Missing or incorrect environment variables can cause the app to fail.
Data format changes: If the Airtable data structure changes, it may break the data processing and display components.
BookingsTable: Displays booking data in a tabular format.
